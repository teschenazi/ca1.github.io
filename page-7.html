                the predetermined nature of their actions and whether they can shape their own destinies. This theme
                invites philosophical contemplation, adding layers of intellectual depth to the narrative.

            <p>
                The corrupting influence of power is vividly portrayed through Griffith's transformation from a
                charismatic leader to a ruthless, god-like figure. The pursuit of power and its moral ambiguity are
                central themes that resonate with contemporary concerns surrounding ambition and its consequences.
            </p>
            <h2>More than just comic books:</h2>
            <P>

                relentless pursuit of his dream. His ambitions yield devastating consequences not just for himself but
                for those around him, illustrating the moral complexities inherent in the relentless pursuit of power.
            </P>
