            <h3>Prior experiences:</h3>
            <p></p>


            <p> I only did my first ever run (32km) out of nowhere on a Sunday afternoon. Before that I would usually do
                my 2-5 k’s after the gym just to relax and have a bigger daily caloric burn.

                I’m 26 and have been into lifting since my teens, but always focused more on that good upper body
                aesthetic which led me to neglect my leg workouts and ultimately regret it years later now.</p>

            <p> Having ran those 32km with no prior experience or planning and only getting a bit of a sore knee
                afterwards, I decided to attempt a full marathon about a month later, doing a half marathon run to train
                for that.

                By the time I had done those 32km, 21km and the full 42km marathon, I had already gotten a serious case
                of runners knee due to my inexperience, weak muscles, bad stride technique and whatever else you name
                it.</p>

            <p>The problem is I was having to much fun so after running those 42km I signed up to a 58km ultra a month
                later. I had 4 weeks to prepare, so I rested and healed for 2 weeks and did my first ever trail run
                (36km 1.3+) in about 5h 30 minutes.

                Again, my knees were in bits by the end of it.</p>




            <h3> Before the run:</h3>
            <p></p>

            <p>I spent the next two weeks reading and researching what was causing my runners knee, at the same time
                focusing on my healing process and getting all my nutrition and gear risked in for the race. I’m sort of
                an experienced ultralight hiker so although I was in uncharted waters I had some experiences with gear
                checking and nutrition for performance.
                I also did some smaller training runs at a slower pace to get a better stride technique and learn to use
                my hips/hamstrings/quads better so I wouldn’t be relying on my knees too much. Watched my foot landing
                and paid a lot of attention to my form, I was pretty confident I could finish this race about one week
                out. </p>

            <p>The last day before was pretty much travelling to the other side of Ireland and getting the finishing
                touches on all my gear and nutrition for race day. Quite anxious at this point but also happy and
                celebrating som other personal achievements, decided to have a fancy dinner out and ended up quite
                drunk. To be fair, I had about three hours of sleep during the night before the race and still had a bit
                of a hangover when I got to shower ten minutes before my alarm since I had lost any hope of sleep a long
                time ago.</p>
            <h3>The Race:</h3>


            <p>Race day started pretty wild since I was unaware I should have gone through a registration the prior
                night, so I had no bib or tracker. I assumed I’d get those before getting on the bus to the start line
                but I was quite wrong. The director of the race saw my instant panic and dread once she gave me the news
                but also was a very nice human being and let me compete with no bib. Luckily my tracker still was around
                and I had it on me before the start but it without a scare.

                We all gathered around the start line and it’s about 80 of us, maybe more. My heart is pounding since I
                got a lot of social anxiety so I’m just trying to keep my mind on having a smooth slow start.
            <p>

            <h3>1km - 17km</h3>

            <p>I slowly jog and keep a consistent pace, I’m not rushing and it’s quite a slog since there’s so many of
                us to traverse gates, also a lot of uphill. I’m nervous and had never done any sports or competed at
                anything before. I never attended any games nor watched anything similar so I really don’t feel on my
                comfort zone here. I’m also worried about my knees, but everything is going smooth so far as we leave
                the small town of Sneem and enter The Kerry Way on our way to Kenmare.

            <h3>17km - 32km</h3>

            <p>Some interesting things happen here. We have gone through a couple of hills already and I have now passed
                some people who rushed the start.

                We start to get into some beautiful landscapes (it’s also my first time in this section of the trail),
                and I let myself relax as all the groups start to form and I’m around the middle pack. I sink into the
                mountains and valleys, and start to get in a vibe.

                We reach a foggy technical terrain, and I start to feel my left knee, which was not unexpected but also
                got me pretty anxious. I remember that being so nervous, my form suffered and I ended up feeling so much
                pain I had to stop and even then I could barely walk downhill. I’m not even halfway in and deep in the
                trail. There’s nowhere else to go, might as well deal with it there.</p>

            <p>I try to relax and remember all I need to do is keep a good form and use the right parts of my body to do
                this. I slowly start to jog back and pick up my own pace. At some point I start to really feel good now,
                using a correct stride and with proper hip motion I start to pass people again.

                My eyes start to fill up in tears due to the realisation of what I’m managing to do and we all know how
                emotions sort of play into us out there sometimes. I keep a steady pace with your usual uphill walk, but
                I feel great and strong, never doubted for a second I wasn’t able to finish this race.

                On about the the last section before the first aid station, I had to cross a gnarly hill while the sun
                toasted me alive. I’m too used to be active at night and the Irish weather is quite cool during the year
                but this has been a hot summer and up there on that dry hill I’d say it was the slowest section for me.
                I had no water and my coke was also gone by now, sweating like crazy I didn’t want to wait until the aid
                station and filled up my flask in a small little river we crossed before another ascent.</p>

            <p>Some guys passed me for the second time here and commented I was very brave to drink that water, to which
                I replied wasn’t an issue since my flask had a filter to which they just agreed but I could detect a bit
                of skepticism on them, I laughed it off with myself though though.</p>


            <h3>32km - 58km</h3>

            <p>My original idea was to only stay at the aid station for 8 to 12 minutes but I ended up eating a whooping
                22min there. You can lose track of time when you sit down and it was hard to chew on my sandwich since I
                was already a bit fatigued and doing anything felt like a big deal here. It was a lesson learned and I
                will definitely mind how much time I spend next time. My time at the aid station consisted of putting
                another banana and gels into my vest, drinking a Powerade and eating one sandwich.

                The walk of shame uphill back to the race was slow and steep, proper trekking pole use helped me a lot
                here. About 20 to 30 minutes only uphill until I was able to ride the road running on a downhill and
                flat for a while.

                Passing people again as we enter the last valley, I’m still feeling great. As a matter of fact I start
                to
                switch gears to a faster pace and just enjoy the run while o soak in all the atmosphere of this valley.
                Other runners keep encouraging me and congratulating as I pass them on the final stretch.

                Everything about it feels amazing, I knew the last part of the route would be quite downhilly and having
                my knees not fully recovered made me a bit anxious about it but yet I’m blazing through the hills,
                riding the wind and feeling like I just discovered I had a super power.</p>

            <p>I only really started to lose my gas on the last 5k but I think that’s because I knew I was so close to
                finish and all those mental games started. I did my best to encourage all the other competitors as I
                passed them, I remember not wanting it to be over but the finish line came really fast for me.</p>

            <p>Finishing at 9:22 put me around the middle pack, I guess that I could’ve pushed it harder and definitely
                should’ve spent less time on that aid station but all I wanted was to really finish and I knew I
                couldn’t be in shape to actually compete in this.

                I was pretty satisfied with the results and learned a lot with this race. I signed myself up for my
                first
                50 miler 4 weeks after this first ultra and am quite excited for that.

                My knees were in bits after the ultra, but healed quite fast since it’s been a week. I’ve clocked in
                some
                smaller runs since but am preparing the build up to get some bigger ones before tapering.</p>
