                and the battle between man and nature is a timeless masterpiece of American literature.</p>

            <p>The novella begins with Santiago, an impoverished and weathered fisherman, feeling the weight of his bad
                luck as he heads out to sea in his small skiff. He is determined to catch a big fish, believing that his
                fortunes will change if he can bring in a substantial catch. Santiago's character is stoic and
                reflective, drawing on his years of experience and wisdom as he faces the challenges of the sea.</p>

            <h2>Internal dialogues and real battles:</h2>
            <p></p>
            <p>Santiago's struggle with a giant marlin serves as the central conflict of the story. The battle between
                man and fish is both physical and psychological, spanning several days and nights. The marlin is a
                symbol of Santiago's determination, strength, and relentless pursuit of his goal. As he hooks the fish,
                he is drawn into a grueling test of endurance as he fights to reel it in, even though it threatens to
                consume him.
            </p>
            <p>Throughout the novella, Santiago's thoughts provide insight into his character and philosophy on life. He
                reflects on his connection to the sea, his reverence for the creatures he catches, and his sense of
                isolation as an old man living in a small fishing village. Santiago's inner monologues reveal a deep
                respect for the natural world and a sense of humility in the face of the vast ocean.</p>


            <h2>What makes one human:</h2>
            <p></p>

                novella explores themes of solitude, suffering, and the indomitable human spirit. Santiago's
                determination and resolve in the face of adversity resonate with readers, making him a symbol of the
                human capacity for resilience and the pursuit of one's dreams.</p>


            <p></p>
            <p>Despite his eventual success in catching the marlin, Santiago's journey home is fraught with challenges.
                Sharks
                are drawn to the scent of the marlin's blood and threaten to devour his prized catch. Santiago's efforts
                to
                protect the marlin's meat showcase his unwavering commitment to his goal and his sense of honor.</p>

            <p>"The Old Man and the Sea" is a story of triumph and tragedy, highlighting the cyclical nature of life and
                the
                inevitability of struggle. It's a profound meditation on the human condition, emphasizing the importance
                of
                perseverance, dignity, and the pursuit of one's passions, even in the face of seemingly insurmountable
                odds.
                Santiago's journey serves as a timeless parable of the human spirit's capacity to endure and find
                meaning in the
                most challenging circumstances. Hemingway's prose, characterized by its simplicity and depth, elevates
                this
                novella to a classic work of literature that continues to captivate and inspire readers of all
